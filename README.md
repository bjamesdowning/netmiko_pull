# netmiko_pull

SSH_Connect.py was my first attempt at automation via screen scraping using tkinter as a GUI to grab variables and netmiko to log in and perform functions.

ciscoManagement.py is my second attempt at the same task, but in an easier CLI way. Is pulls variables from a doc within the same directory to create lists. Command list, and a device list. I use this one to push configuration to devices. Still need to figure out an intuitive way to determine if the command being run needs to be in exec or config mode.
